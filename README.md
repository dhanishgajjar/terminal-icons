## How to Contribute

 - Download the sample icon sketch file. Change the colors and create your icon, without changing any dimensions.
 - Select the artboard and export a `svg` file.
 - Select the artboard again and export a `png` file, but @0.25x (256 x 256)
 - Download the [Image2Icon](http://www.img2icnsapp.com) App
 - Drop the svg as source and export a .ICNS for macOS
 - If you can afford pay for in-app purchases, so you can also export to .ico. If not then find an alternative way to create a .ico file from a `svg`
 - Send pull request for icon files only, DO NOT commit the sample sketch icon file

## How to Install

**Mac OS:**

Easiest way to change the icons is by using https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/. Just Drag and Drop the custom icon and hit `Apply Changes`.

Copy the `.icns` file you'd like to use. Find VS Code in your Applications folder, right click the icon and select `Get Info`. Click the icon in the top right corner so that a blue highlight appears around it. `âŒ˜ + V` to paste the new icon in. It may take a few restarts of VS Code for the icon to take.

If for some reason that doesn't work, then dragging the `.icns` to the icon (in the top left) of the info pane, until you see the green plus sign and then dropping it works.

**Windows:**

Right click on the shortcut App Icon, select properties and then shortcut tab and then `change icon` button.

**Linux:**

I think this works, but not sure https://smdavis.us/projects/menulibre/
